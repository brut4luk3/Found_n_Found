# found_n_found
This a lost and found CRUD with a basic structure.

This is a basic CRUD that I'm making with the Django Framework, whose main purpose will be to register material objects 
(such as documents, books, pens and reading glasses) and the places where you just stored them. 
It'll be very useful after a long clean-up of your house, so that you won't have to waste several
hours trying to figure out where you hid that tasty chocolate bar...
